# Docker Hello World

## Reason

This is a Docker container created so I can teach myself how to make 
them and put them on Docker Hub.

Adapted from [Derrick's HackLafayette Talk](https://github.com/dskard/hl-tt-docker-201905).

## Status

As of this point, I have put it on Github, so connecting to my [Docker Hub Page](https://hub.docker.com/u/jacoby), is next.
